			<p>You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.

		I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.

		Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

		I thought this might be a good opportunity for... improving the foundations.

		Never underestimate Gotham City. People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week. Sometimes things just go bad.

		It will be extremely painful... for you

		I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger.

		It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.

		Very well. Death! By exile.

		Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body?

		You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

		I'm not wearing hockey pads.

		You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.

		How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.</p>
