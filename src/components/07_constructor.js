					<p>Looking at our state/setState Codepen we can see what is happening with the constructor.</p>
					<p>We've called the constructor so that we can set the initial state and we've called it and super with props so that we 
					can access this.props.</p>
					<p>We've also included a few bindings in the constructor because we want "this" to be bound to both these functions.</p>
